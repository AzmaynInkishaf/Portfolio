## [Classification Model for Breast Tumor]([https://github.com/AzmaynInkishaf/Classification-Model-for-Breast-Tumor/tree/main](https://github.com/AzmaynInkishaf/Classification-Model-for-Breast-Cancer))

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among woman and there are over 2.3 million recorded patients annually. Early detection of the tumor is critical to improve the sucess of treatment and minimize the chances of complication. Machine learning algorithms can be instrumental for this purpose by offering sophisticated method for analyzing complex medicant statistics to generate precise predictions for tumor classification. This project utilizes such techniques to create effective models that can differentiate tumors based on biopsy features. The approach involves examining multiple variables, exploring various models and evaluating the performance to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate timely intervention.
