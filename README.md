### [Classification Model for Breast Tumor](https://github.com/AzmaynInkishaf/Classification-Model-for-Breast-Tumor)

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women and there are over 2.3 million recorded patients annually. Early detection of the tumor is critical to improve the success of treatment and minimize the chances of complications. Machine learning algorithms can be instrumental for this purpose by offering sophisticated methods for analyzing complex medical statistics to generate precise predictions for tumor classification. This project utilizes such techniques to create effective models that can differentiate tumors based on biopsy features. The approach involves examining multiple variables, exploring various models and evaluating the performance to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate timely intervention.

### [Clustering Model for Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/AzmaynInkishaf/Clustering-Model-for-Customer-Segmentation/tree/main)

The global commerce industry is projected to reach $6.3 trillion and there is substantial competition within the market. Understanding the distinct customer segments is crucial for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies for enhancing customer engagement. Machine learning algorithms plays a pivotal function in this process by enabling the analysis of complex datasets to uncover patterns that traditional methods might overlook. This project focuses on creating a clustering model to segment customers effectively and aiming to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing. The approach involves using a customer instance dataset to visualize patterns and create distinct groups of individuals based on their characteristics.
